Just some personal experiments with graphql and react-apollo

# Install
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn
```

# Start the dev server
```
npm run dev
```

## app

http://localhost:3000

## graphiQL

http://localhost:3000/graphiql

-----

at first i build this project to learn graphql and show it at work,
following this great egghead tutorial:

> https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-graphql-server

Structured with basic git tags to show the evolution
```
git tag

git checkout 1
```
the first 13 steps/atgs are following the egghead tutorial (not very strictly ;))

-----

later on i just kept using this project to practice nextjs (for server side rendering), styled-components, and some other stuff
